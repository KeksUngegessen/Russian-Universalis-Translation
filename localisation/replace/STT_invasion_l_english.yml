 stt_wek.de.1: "In recent years, Aachen has made a difficult and thorny journey from the free city of the Holy Roman Empire to a fully fledged republic with considerable power in Germany and beyond..\n\nThe city has become an economic centre with a high level of culture and education, and its prestige is overshadowed by the largest cities in Europe..\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a flourishing and generally stable life, people began to remember Aachen's great past. He was once the capital of a great empire....\n\nAnd today, thousands of people have taken to the streets of the capital, begging you to accept the crown and start the path towards the revival of the Empire of the West. In addition, you have the support of the aristocracy (most likely, they just want to take advantage of it), but the estates that impinge on the republican order are likely to be against."

After the order in Rome was restored, Charles and Pope Leo III came to St. Peter's Basilica for the Christmas service. It was during this divine service that the people of Rome and the Bishops witnessed the legendary scene that has since gone down in history..\n\nCharles stood kneeling in a pious pose before the altar when Pope Leo the Third approached him from behind and suddenly laid the imperial crown on his head. Charles was ostensibly very surprised by this, but in fact quite expected it..\n\nNow circumstances have changed, but the tradition has remained the same. Today, the Pope will lay the Imperial Crown in the throne room of Aachen's palace and a new era will begin not only for our power, but for humanity as a whole..\n\nHistorical reference. Carl's full title sounded like...: «Karolus serenissimus augustus a Deo coronatus magnus pacificus imperator Romanum imperium gubernans qui et per misericordiam dei rex Francorum atque Langobardorum». The translation is approximately as follows: "Charles, the most gracious august, crowned by God, great peacemaker, ruler of the Roman Empire, by the grace of God king of the Franks and Lombards.»"

(Background: Zhretses' activity in ancient Scandinavia was extremely extensive.
