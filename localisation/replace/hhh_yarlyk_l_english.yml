 rushorde.2.t:0 "New challenger for the Label"
 rushorde.2.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] got Khan's attention to his person. Khan recognized him as the new contender for the Grand Ducal Label. In five years, that status will need to be confirmed. Now, if he keeps the location of the khan and his status, he will be the next Grand Duke, after the death of the present. The main thing is not to spoil relations with the Golden Horde.."
