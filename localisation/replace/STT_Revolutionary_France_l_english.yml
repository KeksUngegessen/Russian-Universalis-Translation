The purpose of this proposal was that the execution by beheading should no longer be the privilege of the nobility, and that the process of execution should be carried out as soon as possible and cause as little suffering as possible. After a long debate, Guilotin's idea of the death penalty by beheading was adopted, and this method of execution was introduced into a penal code drawn up by the Assembly (which became law in 1791).)."

The Institute of the Department was created by the laws of January 15 and February 16, 1790, and the borders between the departments were defined under the influence of Honoré Gabriel Ricketti de Mirabeau. The local characteristics, but not the regional identity, were taken into account for fear of bringing the province back to life under the old regime.."

 addon.6.desc:0 "The movement against the establishment of a constitutional monarchy found its expression in the form of demonstrations on the Field of Mars. Both Jacobins and Cordelaires were initially united in their views on the future of France. The capture of the Bastille and subsequent events led to people in power who sought to preserve the constitutional monarchy. But the apparent betrayal of the king when he wanted to flee abroad did not inspire a lot of optimism about the idea. So the majority was still in favour of establishing a republic.... \nAfter numerous discussions and the resulting disagreement, the Jacobins' club was separated from the Fellows. However, this did not prevent the cordellers and the Jacobins from drawing up a general text of the petition, which required the king to be deposed.. \nSoon the National Assembly issued its own decree, which confirmed the theory of the "abduction of the king" and accepted the petition back. However, the process could no longer be stopped.. \n17 July 1791, on the Field of Mars, people gathered at the call of cordellers to sign a petition for the king's deposition. As a result, the Jacobins were left alone....\nRight on the field, in the heat of revolutionary importance, a new petition was drawn up, demanding a trial of the king for his treason. But the dominant power stood on its own and bent the line on the constitutional monarchy.. \nThe National Guard was stretched to disperse the masses. The mayor of Paris, Bayeux, tried to disperse the demonstration by force. However, the first masses were helped by a second led by Danton and Demoulin. Weapons were fired....\nFor the first time, representatives of the third estate began to fight each other. After the first salvo of the National Guard, about 50 people died. After the demonstration was dispersed, persecution began against the demonstrators.."

There were no big cities in Vandeya at the time, so the bread was taken to neighbouring regions for sale, which made the price of bread prohibitive..\nGradually intensifying, the unrest moved into an open rebellion. The rebellion spilled at an extraordinary speed. On March 4, 1793, in the town of Cholet, the young men killed the commander of the local National Guard. A week later, on March 10, opponents of the recruit met with Republicans in Mashkula: the number of victims among the latter went to hundreds.

He was repeatedly commended for his bravery. After the conclusion of the Luneville peace, Louis Antoine married Charlotte, niece of Cardinal Rogan, and settled in Ettenheim (Ettenheim; Duchy of Baden). He lived on an English pension..\nIn March 1804, Napoleon heard from his Minister Talleyrand that the Duke of Engyenia was associated with the Kadudal-Pishegrew conspiracy, which at the time seemed to be the main danger to the regime. A certain prince allegedly accompanied Dumurieu's traitor and made secret visits to France. Despite the fact that the name of Dumurieu's companion became known (and it was certainly not the Duke of Engyen), Napoleon gave the order to kidnap the Duke according to a plan drawn up by Talleyrand himself..\nThe Duke of Engyen lived in the town of Ottenheim at this time, spending his days in festivity and love affairs. That was the weakness of the Duke and played the spy Schulmeister. He captured a young woman, the Duke's beloved, and took her to the border town of Belfort. The Duke learned of this and soon received a letter from his beloved, forged by the spy, in which she allegedly begged to be saved from captivity. The Duke immediately rushed to her for help, hoping to bribe the guards and free the lady's heart. That was all the shulmaster needed. Just in case, the attackers had an official document to the Baden authorities accusing the emigrant, which they handed over after the operation..\nAs soon as the Duke of Engyen crossed the French border, he was captured, 15 March 1804 brought to Paris, tried by a military court and at night shot by gendarmes in the forest of Vincent. After the announcement of the verdict, the aristocrat was ready to talk to Napoleon, but according to the recollections of the emperor Talleyrand did not allow this (but he wrote a letter, a copy of which Stendal later saw).
