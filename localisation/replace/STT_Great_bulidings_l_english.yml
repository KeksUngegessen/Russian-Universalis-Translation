The temple itself symbolizes Heavenly Jerusalem, but the meaning of the color coloring of the domes to this day remains an unsolved mystery. Even in the last century, the writer Tea suggested that the color of the domes of the temple can be explained by the dream of Blessed Andrew the Foolish ascetic saint, with whom, according to church tradition, and is associated with the feast of the Protection of the Mother of God.

It was rebuilt by Francesco Sforza in the mid XV century. In the second half of the 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci was attracted to decorate the castle; of his works only pergola and a manuscript with literary experiences are preserved. With the beginning of the Italian wars, Lodovico Sforza fled Milan and the French king Louis XII came to Castello Sforzesco. Under his successor Francis, the castle went into disrepair; in 1521 a lightning struck the gunpowder warehouse in the Tower of Filaret, after which it was dismantled. The Spanish Viceroy, Ferrante Gonzaga, began to fortify the city and built the Sforza Castle into the centre of the new Milanese star-shaped fortifications. The palace chambers were equipped with barracks for 2,000 soldiers.."

One hundred years later, the royal court moved to Castel Nuovo, and the king's treasury and judicial institutions remained in the old castle. In the 15th century the castle was reinforced in case of cannon fire. It was very convenient, because during the Italian Wars, Castel del Ovo had to withstand the fire of French guns.."

 stt_great.ED564767: "The Aachen Imperial Palace is a grand imperial palace of the Palatinate, built at the turn of the 8th and 9th centuries by Charlemagne the Great and intended to serve as the main residence of the Franks' rulers. The construction work was led by Odon of Metz. As building materials used spolitics of ancient buildings, which in abundance imported from Italy. In 805, Pope Leo III, who arrived in Aachen, consecrated the palace chapel in the name of the Virgin Mary..\n\nHowever, by the 14th century the palace was practically in ruins. On the place of the throne room the city hall was built. Only Charlemagne's Chapel with its tomb survived from the palace at that time. Beginning with Otto the Great, all Roman-German emperors were crowned there, sitting on Charles' throne. This tradition was established in the Golden Bull in 1356..\n\nHowever, now the palace complex, famous for its mineral water baths, has been fully restored and even supplemented with modern architectural innovations..
