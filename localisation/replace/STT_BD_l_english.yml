 black_death.1.t:0 "Seaweed"
 black_death.1.d:0 "Northern China is gripped by a strange, rapidly spreading disease. Merchants and travelers report that some cities and towns have been completely deserted. The disease has spared no one: no children, no old people, no women, no poor, rich, no noblemen, no peasants.."
 black_death.1.a1:0 "It happens...."
 black_death.2.t:0 "The sea turmoil is spreading."
 black_death.2.d:0 "$MONARCHTITLE$ , in one of our provinces, people suffer from a strange disease. We're told that in most homes, all living people die at once. The corpses are left lying in the houses, and no priest, no relative son, no father, no loved one dares to enter: gravediggers are promised big money to take out and bury the dead, but not everyone takes on such work. Panic begins in the cities. The deadly scourge drives people to other places so they don't fall prey to the sea...."
 black_death.2.a1:0 "There's no need to panic. The pestilence has happened before."
 black_death.3.t:0 "Black Death"
 black_death.3.d:0 "$MONARCHTITLE$ , Whether it's punishment for our sins or the intrigue of our enemies, people in many of our cities are dying of the plague. Eyewitnesses report that people suffer from continuous fever, and those who get sick fight and delirium. Many people leave their minds, and those affected scream furiously from the windows. Black buboes and tumors appear on their bodies. People's consciousness is obscured. The diseased die within days...."
 black_death.3.a1:0 "This is for our sins.!"
 black_death.4.t:0 "Black Death"
 black_death.4.d:0 "Many officials are leaving their posts. People are fleeing the cities. Doctors refuse to treat the plague, because no one wants to follow their patient. Abandoned homes are looted by looters. Local authorities are unable to do anything...."
 black_death.4.a1:0 "The last days are coming! This is the end.!"
 black_death.5.t:0 "The plague has receded."
 black_death.5.d:0 "Well, then. Although in some places the plague continues to take lives, the total pestilence has stopped. People have learned how to counteract the spread of the disease and the plague has been localized."
 black_death.5.a1:0 "Let's pray it doesn't happen again.."
 black_death.6.t:0 "Plague Doctors"
 black_death.6.d:0 "The cities pay for the services of special "plague doctors", whose duties include staying in the city until the end of the epidemic and treating those who became victims. To protect against "miasms" plague doctors wear a beaky mask, in the beak laid flowers and herbs pink petals, rosemary, laurel, incense, etc., to protect against the plague "miasms" But, unfortunately, such counteraction has not yet yielded results. People are still dying.."
 black_death.6.a1:0 "So far, prayer has remained the most effective way"
 black_death.7.t:0 "Plague in big cities"
 black_death.7.d:0 "The big cities, where the plague spreads instantly, are particularly hard hit. Mountains of corpses lie in the streets, no one wants to approach them, even under fear of death. The living are jealous of the dead.."
 black_death.7.a1:0 "The plague has spared no one."
 black_death.8.t:0 "Plague in big cities"
 black_death.8.d:0 "The big cities, where the plague spreads instantly, are particularly hard hit. Mountains of corpses lie in the streets, no one wants to approach them, even under fear of death. The living are jealous of the dead.."
 black_death.8.a1:0 "The plague has spared no one."
 black_death.9.t:0 "The plague has spared no one."
 black_death.9.d:0 "The disease strikes everyone. Our state cannot fight successfully, there are not enough recruits...."
 black_death.9.a1:0 "But our enemies are also suffering"
 black_death.10.t:0 "Guilty people of the sea"
 black_death.10.d:0 "The mass exodus from the cities of the affluent has given rise to rumors that the rich are deliberately poisoning the poor (while the rich are equally stubbornly accusing the "poor" of spreading the disease, thus trying to take revenge on them).  People's rumors persistently accuse three categories of the devil worshippers, lepers and Jews of artificially infecting them. In the atmosphere of hysteria of poisoning, any foreigner, foreigner, traveler, drunk, foolish, anyone who has attracted attention to himself by differences in clothing, behavior, speech, can no longer feel safe, and if he is found during a search of what the crowd would have considered plague ointment or powder, his fate is predetermined."
 black_death.10.a1:0 "What do they have left to do..."
 black_death.11.t:0 "Farmers' troubles"
 black_death.11.d:0 "The plague is devastating the village as well. There are fewer working hands, the peasants are unable to feed themselves, and under the oppression of local feudal lords they begin to revolt."
 black_death.11.a1:0 "Everyone suffers."
 black_death.12.t:0 "Doctors' arguments"
 black_death.12.d:0 "The doctors' opinions are divided. In their environment, two main directions are struggling. The first ones believe that the cause of the disease is some invisible to the eye "seeds of disease", or the smallest pathogenic "bastards" that penetrate into the body of a healthy person in contact with the disease. As a means of preventive combat against plague, they offer isolation of patients and long-term quarantine. The second seems attractive theory of "miasma" in the summary of the essence of the theory can be reduced to poisoning the body of some poisonous substance released from the earth's bowels. It is based on a quite sound observation about mortality of fens and other unhealthy places for people and about attachment of certain diseases to certain geographical points. Hence, according to "miasmatists", the wind can carry toxic fumes over vast distances."
 black_death.12.a1:0 "The seeds of disease are ruining people."
 black_death.12.a2:0 "The miasma people are being ruined"
 black_death.13.t:0 "The plague has spared no one."
 black_death.13.d:0 "Our heir is dying of the plague."
 black_death.13.a1:0 "..."
 black_death.14.t:0 "The plague has spared no one."
 black_death.14.d:0 "The disease has reached our ruler as well."
 black_death.14.a1:0 "..."
 black_death.15.t:0 "The plague is raging in cities"
 black_death.15.d:0 "The big cities, where the plague spreads instantly, are particularly hard hit. Mountains of corpses lie in the streets, no one wants to approach them, even under fear of death. The living are jealous of the dead.."
 black_death.15.a1:0 "This is the end.!"
 black_death.16.t:0 "The sea is killing people."
 black_death.16.d:0 "The big cities, where the plague spreads instantly, are particularly hard hit. Mountains of corpses lie in the streets, no one wants to approach them, even under fear of death. The living are jealous of the dead.."
 black_death.16.a1:0 "That's awful.!"
 black_death.17.t:0 "Plague in major cities"
 black_death.17.d:0 "The big cities, where the plague spreads instantly, are particularly hard hit. Mountains of corpses lie in the streets, no one wants to approach them, even under fear of death. The living are jealous of the dead.."
 black_death.17.a1:0 "It's never gonna end.!"
 black_death.18.t:0 "Choice of the ruler"
 black_death.18.d:0 "The plague is destroying people, paying little attention to neither status nor wealth. Doctors advise to flee as far away as possible and stay away from the contaminated area long enough to make sure the danger is over. What will you do? $MONARCHTITLE$ ?"
 black_death.18.a1:0 "It's better to hide out and wait."
 black_death.18.a2:0 "What's to be is not to be missed. The ruler will not leave his place.!"
 black_death.19.t:0 "Choice of the ruler"
 black_death.19.d:0 "What should we do? Doctors advise us to shelter our heir in a place that is not prone to damp, away from cemeteries, gravesticks and dirty water, and from gardens where leeks, cabbage or other plants tend to settle or leave plague miasms nearby.?"
 black_death.19.a1:0 "Take the heir to safety"
 black_death.19.a2:0 "Let him stay."
 black_death.20.t:0 "Donations to the Ulema"
 black_death.20.d:0 "In search of the protection of Allah from the plague, people donate their last money to the Ulema, making them much richer.."
 black_death.20.a1:0 "Collect donations"
 black_death.20.a2:0 "It's their money."
 black_death.21.t:0 "There's no good without good."
 black_death.21.d:0 "During the epidemic, churches and monasteries were fabulously enriched; the parishioners give the latter to avoid death. Some municipalities had to limit the amount of voluntary donations by decree. However, out of fear of illness, monks do not go out, and pilgrims are left to fold what is brought in front of the gate, from where it is taken at night."
 black_death.21.a1:0 "The church must share!"
 black_death.21.a2:0 "It's their money."
 black_death.22.t:0 "Bull Clement VI"
 black_death.22.d:0 "In 1350, in the midst of the epidemic, Pope Clement VI declared the next Holy Year, a special bull ordered the angels to immediately take to heaven anyone who died on the road to Rome or returning home. Indeed, about 1 million 200 thousand pilgrims seeking protection from the plague gathered in Rome for Easter, and another million were added to the Trinity, while in this mass the plague was so fierce that hardly a tenth of them returned home. In one year alone, the Roman curia's profit from their donations amounted to an astronomical sum of 17 million florins! Pope Clement VI himself at this time was away from plague-stricken Rome, in his palace in Avignon, on the advice of his personal physician Guy de Choliat, who was well aware of the danger of infection, not letting anyone near him, and constantly maintaining fire in the two roasters, right and left of his person. Paying tribute to the superstitions of the time, the father did not part with the "magic" emerald inserted in the ring, "which, when turned to the South, weakened the action of the plague poison, when turned to the East, reduced the danger of infection.»"
 black_death.22.a1:0 "..."
 black_death.23.t:0 "The war with the plague-stricken state"
 black_death.23.d:0 "We are at war with a state in which the plague is raging. There's a good chance that an epidemic will break out in our lands as well..."
 black_death.23.a1:0 "We will be swept away.!"
 black_death.24.t:0 "Plague ointments and poisoners"
 black_death.24.d:0 "Afflicted by the scale and mortality of the epidemic, the general public cannot believe that such a catastrophe can be of natural origin. Plague poison, in the form of some kind of powder, or as ointments are often thought, must be spread by a poisoner or poisoners, understood to be some outcasts hostile to the general population. In addition, the indiscriminate escape from the cities affected by the disease has created anarchy, panic and mob power. Out of fear of illness, anyone who caused the slightest suspicion, force dragged into the infirmary, the place is so terrible that many people prefer to kill themselves just to not be there. Cases of intentional infection do occur, due to the appearance of superstition that it is possible to get rid of the plague by "passing" it on to another. Therefore, the sick are pushed on purpose in markets and in churches, and as many people as possible get hurt or breathe in the face. Some are in such a hurry to get rid of their enemies. What are we supposed to do?"
 black_death.24.a1:0 "To please the majority, not to obstruct the prosecution of the perpetrators."
 black_death.24.a2:0 "Leave this obscurantism!"
 black_death.25.t:0 "Choreography or the Dance of Death"
 black_death.25.d:0 "Victims of choreomania begin to jump, scream and make ridiculous movements for no apparent reason, really resembling a kind of furious dance. Obsessed crowds of up to a few thousand people get knocked down; it happens that the spectators, up to a certain point just staring at what is happening, join the dancing crowd themselves, unable to stop. Obsessed people cannot and often cover the distance to the neighboring town or village by screaming and jumping. Then they fall to the ground in complete exhaustion and fall asleep on the spot. After that the psychosis sometimes ends, but sometimes it lasts for days or even weeks. Those obsessed with choreomaniacs are reprimanded in churches, sprinkled with holy water, sometimes when other means are exhausted, the city authorities hire musicians to play along with the furious dance and thus rather bring the sick to weariness and sleep."
 black_death.25.a1:0 "Symbiosis!"
 black_death.26.t:0 "Plague, superstition and heresy."
 black_death.26.d:0 "In people's frustrated imagination, from day to day waiting to die, ghosts, ghosts and, finally, "signs" are in any smallest event. Disappointment in medicine and the ability of the official church to stop the epidemic spills over into an attempt by the common people to protect themselves through rituals whose roots go back even to pagan times. For example, in the Slavic lands naked women at night plow the village around, and during the ritual, none of the other residents can leave their homes. The Saami send plagues to the "iron mountains" with songs and spells, and for ease of movement they supply horses and a cart. Scarecrows depicting plague are burned, drowned, buried in walls, cursed and excommunicated in churches. Fear of death from the plague has led to people's superstitions penetrating even the church.."
 black_death.26.a1:0 "Let people find comfort in it."
 black_death.26.a2:0 "Prohibit all heresies and pagan superstitions!"
 black_death.27.t:0 "Long-bearing boots"
 black_death.27.d:0 "Desperate people are looking for the cause of the plague in everything, such as in the fashion of long-nosed shoes.."
 black_death.27.a1:0 "Yeah, it makes sense. To forbid this fashion.!"
 black_death.27.a2:0 "What ignorance!"
 black_death.28.t:0 "Flagellants or Beating"
 black_death.28.d:0 "The members of the sect, driven by a single desire to put their flesh to the test comparable to that which Christ was subjected to before His crucifixion, are grouped into groups of up to several thousand people, led by a single leader, and wander from city to city. Eyewitnesses describe them as monks dressed in black cloaks and hoods, with felt hats and backs "in scars and scabs of caught blood. The flagellants in each of the cities in which they appear demand the total destruction of the Jews as "enemies of Christ", but much worse, from the point of view of the dominant church, that the sect of the beating, being underlined by the worldly in it is not a single clergyman,  pretends to have direct contact with God, rejecting the complex ritualism and hierarchy of Catholicism, preaching on his own, as well as freely accepting the sacrament of confession and absolving one another of his sins. How should we be?"
 black_death.28.a1:0 "Let them do what they want."
 black_death.28.a2:0 "To put these heretics to fire.!"
 black_death.29.t:0 "Bianchi"
 black_death.29.d:0 "Processions bianchi gather in cities no less crowds than the processions of their more radical fellow flagellants. Dressed in white, with candles and crucifixions in their hands, they move, singing prayers and psalms, praying for "mercy and peace", and the procession is necessarily headed by a woman walking between two young children. The Bianchi directly reproach the church for their stealing, selfishness and forgetfulness of God's commandments, for which the Lord punished his people with an epidemic. The Bianchi demand that the high priest give up the throne voluntarily, ceding it to the "poor pope".»"
 black_death.29.a1:0 "Let them keep demanding that we."
 black_death.29.a2:0 "To ban this godforsaken heresy...!"
 black_death.30.t:0 "Persecution of Jews"
 black_death.30.d:0 "In connection with the plague, conspiracy theories mature in the minds of people, according to which the Jews, having decided to contribute to the early death of their enemies, secretly gathered in Toledo and decided to lime the Christians with poison, whether from flesh and blood, an owl milled into a powder of poisonous spiders, or from the dried heart of a Christian combined with spiders, frogs and lizards. This "devilish composition" was then secretly sent to all countries with the categorical order to pour it into wells and rivers. According to one version, behind the back of the Jewish leaders stands a Saracen ruler, on the other, they act on their own initiative. The anti-Jewish hysteria was aggravated by the fact that the body of a tortured boy nailed to the cross was found. It was considered a travesty on the crucifixion and the charge fell on the Jews. The Jews were also accused of stabbing with needles stolen from the Christians until the Savior's blood began to drip from them. How are we supposed to be?"
 black_death.30.a1:0 "Ban Jewish persecution!"
 black_death.30.a2:0 "Christ's murderers must answer for everything.!"
 black_death.31.t:0 "Yahudas are spreading the disease."
 black_death.31.d:0 "In the wake of the plague, conspiracy theories are ripening in the minds of people, according to which the Jews deliberately shake water wells so that as many believers as possible may die of the plague, so that they may take possession of their property.."
 black_death.31.a1:0 "Leave people's scriptures alone."
 black_death.31.a2:0 "Every infidel must pay for his crimes.!"
 black_death.32.t:0 "Council of the Wise"
 black_death.32.d:0 "$MONARCHTITLE$ , the plague is raging in our lands, claiming thousands and thousands of lives. Although there are no effective ways of resisting the epidemic, should we gather a council of wise advisors, healers and sorcerers...?"
 black_death.32.a1:0 "Gather advice"

 black_death.33.t:0 "Council of the Wise"
