 desc_hhh_dt_l:0 "At the beginning of the XV century, the medieval epoch, bravura in its sluggishness, is located at the outlet. Crusades, knights and mighty orders are a thing of the past. In the East, the last nomadic empires perish, preparing to give way forever to new, powerful Muslim powers. In the West, defeated by feudal strife, England and France raise their heads. In Castile and Portugal, future seafarers are born, while in Italy, future Risorgimento figures are falling to their mother's breast. In the east of Europe, Poland unites and Lithuania becomes powerful. Russian cities have almost dropped the yoke and will soon be united again. This is a new world and a new era.."

In France, this property was seized by the King's agents on 13 October 1307, a little later than elsewhere. Clement V immediately demanded that it be handed over to the Church to be used for the Holy Land. It was also necessary to determine who would manage the Templar's possessions pending the outcome of the trial: the monarchs did not cede and retained this right. King Aragon openly said that he would leave part of the Order's property behind the crown at any rate.."

 hhh_dark_times_events.3.d:0 "Powder was known in China since the IX century, the method of its production was obtained around 1240 in Egypt, but despite this, the first guns in Europe appeared only in the XIII century and used very little. The first representative of artillery was the bombardment, known since the beginning of the XIV century. But because of the huge difficulties associated with the operation, the active and continuous use of guns began only in the middle of the XIV century. This changed the course and methods of warfare in many ways, and was one of the indicators of the end of the Middle Ages."
 hhh_dark_times_events.4.d:0 "The first book in history that detailed the process of purification of calcium nitrate, and described how to prepare black powder in the right quantitative ratio for the explosion was a book by the scientist of the Mamluk sultanate Hassan Al Rammakh. The work on the synthesis of explosive powder by Hassan al-Rammah gave rise to the development of guns and rockets. This allowed the Egyptian Mamelukes to be among the first to use guns in the military regularly...."
