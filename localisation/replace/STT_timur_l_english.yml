 stt_rise_timur.1.t:0 "Birth of Timur"
 stt_rise_timur.1.d:0 "Not far from the great city of Samarkand, in the village of Kesh, a son, Timur ibn Taragai Barlas, was born to the leader of the local Taragai tribe. The most remarkable thing was that the boy turned out to be red-haired, like his distant ancestor Genghis. Is this a sign that this man will determine the fate of the world in the future...?"
 stt_rise_timur.1.a:0 "Keep me informed.."
 stt_rise_timur.2.t:0 "A talented military commander"
 stt_rise_timur.2.d:0 "One of the local leaders has recently proved himself to be a good one. I think his name is Timur. Should we make him a commander?"

 stt_rise_timur.3.a:0 "Let him be my general."
 stt_rise_timur.4.t:0 "Strategic marriage"
 stt_rise_timur.4.d:0 "After the collapse of the single Chagatai ulus, our position is still fragile. The fact is that the throne can be fully occupied only by the descendants of Genghis Khan. In Mogulistan now rules one of the branches of the Genghisid dynasty. If we are related to their ruler, we can strengthen the foundations of our power...."
 stt_rise_timur.4.a:0 "Good idea.."
 stt_rise_timur.4.b:0 "To be born with the worst enemy? Absolutely not.!"
 stt_rise_timur.5.t:0 "Transoxian Heritage"
 stt_rise_timur.5.d:0 "The ruler of the Transoxiana died while hunting. Without leaving an heir, he condemned the young state. The Chagathaid ruler of Mogulistan invaded the country and took over. Some claim he was the one responsible for the accident. What happens next will only show time."
 stt_rise_timur.5.a:0 "Appoint Regent of Timur"
 stt_rise_timur.5.b:0 "Appoint Becchik as regent."
 stt_rise_timur.6.t:0 "The Trans-Oxian coup"

 stt_rise_timur.6.a:0 "Okay .."
 stt_rise_timur.7.t:0 "Hussein Uprising"
 stt_rise_timur.7.d:0 "Hussein, grandson of Emir Kazagan, former ruler of Transoxiana, has revolted against the invaders. His main force is in Kabul..."
 stt_rise_timur.7.a:0 "Destroy the rebel.!"
 stt_rise_timur.8.t:0 "Timur joins the uprising."
 stt_rise_timur.8.d:0 "Timur, after a quarrel with the ruler of Mogulistan and his protégé, decided to help his old friend Hussein, grandson of the former ruler of Tranoxiana.."
 stt_rise_timur.8.a:0 "It's sad... but it won't help Hussein...."
 stt_rise_timur.9.t:0 "Timur's victory"
 stt_rise_timur.9.d:0 "Hussein and Timur, joining forces, seized power in Transoxiana. Hussein took control because his origins are higher than those of Timur. The latter became his right hand. To consolidate power, Hussein set up a fake ruler from the Chagataid dynasty.."
 stt_rise_timur.9.a:0 "Yeah, that's tough.."
 stt_rise_timur.10.t:0 "The war of Timur against Hussein"
 stt_rise_timur.10.d:0 "After the seizure of power in the city, Hussein again became Supreme Emir of Maverannahr and Timur with his right hand. Soon after, Hussein, who sought to shake the situation of Timur, imposed a huge tax on his supporters, referring to previous debts. He decided to turn the situation around and paid the debts from his resources. It is indicative that as a payment, among other things, Timur sent Hussein jewelry to his beloved wife, and the Emir's sister, Uljai Turkan aga. Hussein acknowledged the jewels, but did not give them back. When the people found out about it, they recognized and branded him as a sneaky merchant. Hussein's comrades-in-arms began to take Timur's side as a result of such events. As a result, intrigue and strife resulted in an open conflict between former comrades-in-arms and friends. The only force restraining this struggle was Timur's beloved wife and sister Hussein. But in 1367, she died, the only bastion that held back the power war between emirs."
 stt_rise_timur.10.a:0 "Let's destroy the enemy.."
 stt_rise_timur.11.t:0 "Hussein's fate"
 stt_rise_timur.11.d:0 "After the battle in Balkh, where he won a grand victory, Timur called the Kurultai and brought Hussein there. Remembering their joint trials and trampled friendship, Timur wept. Huseyn's fate was decided on this kurultai, and the winner declared that he would not break this word and would not kill Huseyn. However, when Kaykhosrov Khattulyan demanded the right to kill Hussein, Timur was silent. The Kurultai agreed that Kaikhossrov had the right to do so because of blood vengeance, since shortly before that Hussein had killed Kaikhossrov's brother, Kaikubad. Thus, Timur removed the last obstacle in the full possession of Maverannahr. Hussein stabbed Kaikhossrov Khattulyan by right of blood vengeance near Balkh. Hussein's two sons, after his death, were burned and their ashes scattered in the wind. The rest of the defeated's allies fled to India...."
 stt_rise_timur.11.a:0 "Who's going to be the new ruler?"
 stt_rise_timur.12.t:0 "Turan Education"
 stt_rise_timur.12.d:0 "In the depths of the Maverannahr, in the town of Balkh, a kurultai took place, where almost all Chagatai beki, emirs, terezmshahs and other dignitaries gathered. The meeting was relatively peaceful: it was decided that the new ruler of the ulus would be Timur, who had repeatedly proved himself earlier, taking the title of the upper emir of Turan and taking as his wife the daughter of Genghisid. Thus, in the East appeared a young and strong state, led by a talented leader and ready to conquer all the surrounding land."
 stt_rise_timur.12.a:0 "What awaits the young state?"
 stt_rise_timur.14.t:0 "Accession of the Serbedars"
 stt_rise_timur.14.d:0 "By 1337, the Serb state had been formed, which existed until 1381. The ruler of the state was elected by the assembly. Any citizen, regardless of material wealth, could become the ruler. In the period c 1337 In 1344, the Serbs defeated three militias of the Mongol-Turkic nobility, liberating Nishapur and western Khorasan. In 1381, Tamerlane, being already the sole ruler of the state with its capital in Samarkand, took Sebzevar, and the state of the Serbs ceased to exist. Most of the Serbs voluntarily took Tamerlane's side.."
 stt_rise_timur.14.a:0 "It was easy."
 stt_rise_timur.15.t:0 "The Fall of the Cartids"
 stt_rise_timur.15.d:0 "Guillaz oud-Din Pir Ali, tried to destabilize the Sarbédar state by calling on the dervishes in his lands to oppose the Serbs. In response, Ali Muayadd conspired with Malik Muhammad. Soon, the Serbs entered a period of internal turmoil, which Giyas did not fail to use and captured Nishapur (1376). At the same time, both Giyas and Muhammad tried to persuade Tamerlane: the first ambassador to him was an embassy, while the second personally sought refuge from Tamerlane when he was expelled to Serakhs. Tamerlan eventually supported Guillaz and offered marriage between his niece Sevinj Kutlug Agha and Guillaz's son Pir Muhammad. The wedding took place in Samarkand around 1376. Later on, Tamerlan invited Giyas to the council, but he evaded the visit under the pretext of suppressing the Shiite uprising in Nishapur. Then Tamerlan decided to invade the lands of the Kartids. The invasion was supported by many prominent residents of Khorasan: for example, former vizier Muin ad-Din Jami sent a letter of invitation to Tamerlane, and Sheikhs Jam persuaded influential dignitaries to welcome Tamerlane on his way to Herat. In April 1381, Tamerlane's army approached the city. The townspeople were demoralized, and they were also aware of his promise to spare all those who would not oppose him with weapons in their hands. The city fell, its fortifications were destroyed, theologians and scientists were sent to the lands of Tamerlane, the townspeople were heavily taxed, and Guiyas ud-Din and his son were sent as prisoners to Samarkand.."

 stt_rise_timur.16.d:0 "In 1386 Timur has grasped Mazandaran at once when tried to besiege Zagros. He experienced strong resistance from the townspeople, for which he imposed huge taxes. Timur put the governor Adil Ike, who a few years later was executed for corruption...."

 stt_rise_timur.17.t:0 "Calming Mogulistana"
 stt_rise_timur.17.d:0 "It is necessary to conquer Mogulistan to secure the borders of the state.

After Timur's death in 1405, an internecine war began. Power in Maverannahr was seized by his grandson Khalil-Sultan (1405-1409), and in Khorasan after several military clashes, power passed to Timur's youngest son - Shahrukh. In 1409, after the defeat of Khalil-Sultan, the Timurid warlords also transferred power to Shahrukh in Maverannahr. He made Herat his capital, and appointed three of his four sons (Ulugbek, Ibrahim Sultan and Suyurgatmisha) as rulers of different regions. During the reign of Shah Rukh, Herat became the largest centre of science and culture in the East. His son Baysonkur established an art academy here, from which the famous Behzad later emerged.
