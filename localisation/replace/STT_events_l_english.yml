However, Kazimir was slow, fearing that the tycoons and gentry would later impose their will on him, even though he could rule autocratically in Lithuania. And then the panes made a strong move, threatening to give the crown to Prince Boleslav IV of Masovia, the very same, with whom the Grand Duchy was in hostile relations. Casimir was faced with a difficult choice. Is it worthwhile to engage in a conflict in the West in conditions of unfriendly relations with other neighbors in order to preserve the sole rule of the Grand Duchy?

However, on 10 November 1444, the army of crusaders led by the Polish and Hungarian king suffered a terrible defeat at Varna, and Vladislav III himself died. And then the panes offered the throne to Casimir, however, that in every way stalled time, rightly assuming that in Krakow, his power will try to limit as much as possible. But in the end, the Grand Duke of Lithuania agreed to the proposal, fearing that the crown would fall to the enemy of the Litvins Boleslav IV Mazovetsky. And now Boleslav and his lands will not go anywhere, and Poland and Lithuania together will be able to equally resist any neighboring country.."

And today the answer came from Vilnius: the Grand Duke of Lithuania refused to become King of Poland and return Lithuania to the eternal alliance with our country. And let us later make the Lithuanians pay for this with our lands, but now the country needs a new monarch. We can, of course, invite to Krakow Bolesław IV Mazowiecki of the Piast family, whose election we threatened his friend Casimir, but the king, who has his own huge estates, will be much less ruled. On the other hand, it is always possible to choose a candidate from among the influential panes, who will owe much to his supporters and will surely reward them with dignity.

The Brest Union led to the establishment of the Greek Catholic Church in the Rzeczpospolita. In 1700, the Greek Catholic Church was joined by Lviv, and in 1702 by the Diocese of Lutsk, which completed the transition of the Orthodox dioceses of the Rzeczpospolita to Greek Catholicism. As a result of the union in the Metropolitanate of Kyiv there was a split into Uniates (Greek Catholics) and opponents of unification with the Roman Catholic Church. The ruling circles and the Catholic nobility of the Rzeczpospolita, headed by King Sigismund III, fully sided with the Uniates, transferring traditional Orthodoxy to the position of an illegal and persecuted by the authorities confession, as well as transferring its property to the Uniates. From the point of view of the authorities of the Rzeczpospolita, the Brest Union contributed to the weakening of the Moscow Patriarchate's claims to the lands of Southwestern Russia and the spiritual ties between the Orthodox in the Rzeczpospolita and the Russian state.."
