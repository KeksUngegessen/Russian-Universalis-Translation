    stt_serbia.1.t:0 "The collapse of the Serbo-Greek kingdom"
    stt_serbia.1.d:0 "With the death of King Stephen Dušan IV, the Serbo-Greek kingdom began to disintegrate: the former Byzantine lands were freed in the first place, and in Serbia itself, local landowners came to power here and there.

    stt_serbia.2.d:0 "A Serbian delegation has recently arrived in Constantinople to request the title of despot of the Prince of Serbia.

    stt_serbia.4.d:0 "The Hungarians, seeing our strengthening on the peninsula, offered us the city of Belgrade in exchange for help in wars with the Ottomans. The offer seems tempting, but no one is sure that the Hungarians will not return their gift back soon, when we do the work.."
    stt_serbia.4.a:0 "It's a profitable offer.."
    stt_serbia.4.b:0 "Let them look for allies somewhere else.."
