# Russian-Universalis-Translation

Please note that this is a sub-mod for Russian Universalis, providing only a translation into English, so you will need
to [subscribe to the base mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1862741477) too.

## What is Russian Universalis?

To learn more about Russian Universalis, head over to
their [mod page](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1862741477) or come and help with building the
English community of Russian Universalis on [their Discord!](https://discord.gg/ZE6JhdJ)

## Technical details

Although the translations are mostly pretty good, there will be bad grammar, since I obviously didn't translate the mod
by hand. I can't even speak Russian. If you want to learn more about this, head over to this
mod's [GitHub page.](https://github.com/KeksUngegessen/Russian-Universalis-Translation)  
The original mod devs put such a large amount of work into their mod, and it would take a normal person many months to
translate this huge amount of content. Please bear that in mind. Thanks :)

This leaves the question on who actually did the quality control, because I can't check any of the translations myself.
That's the part where I ask you to help me. If there are insufficient translations bothering you, please go ahead,
correct them and make a pull request.

## Hints and tips

- In the new Paradox launcher, make sure that this mod is placed after Russian Universalis in the load order, otherwise
  the translations will be overwritten.
- After updating this mod it has happened several times that certain files were not updated correctly locally. If this
  also applies to you, just try to unsubscribe and download the mod again.
